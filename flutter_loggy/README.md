# Flutter loggy
Here are extensions that we can use in Flutter to make logger even better.
Included is `PrettyDeveloperPrinter`.

## Pretty developer printer
This printer uses `dart:developer` and can write error messages in red, and it gives us more flexibility, so we can modify this log a bit more.
